	<p>	And so my life has been guided</p>
	<p>	All the love I needed was provided</p>
	<p>	And through my mothers sacrifices I saw where her life went</p>
	<br>
	<p>	To give more than birth to me, but life to me</p>
	<p>	And this ain’t one of the clichés about black women being strong</p>
	<p>	Cause hell if you’re weak, you’re gone</p>
	<p>	But life courage, determined to do more than just survive</p>
	<br>
	<p>	And too many homes have a missing woman or man</p>
	<p>	Without the feeling of missing love</p>
	<br>
	<p>	Maybe they are homes that are hurt</p>
	<p>	But there are no real lives that hurt will not reach, that are not broken</p>
	<p>	Unless the homes of soldiers – stationed overseas</p>
	<p>	Or lost in battles, are broken</p>
	<p>	Unless the homes of firemen, policemen, construction workers,</p>
	<p>	Seamen, railroad men, truckers, pilots</p>
	<p>	Who lost their lives – but not what their lives stood for...</p>
	<p>	Because men die, men lose, they are lost and they leave</p>
	<p>	And so do women...</p>
	<br>
	<p>	I came from what they called a broken home</p>
	<p>	But if they ever really called at our house</p>
	<p>	They would have known how wrong they were</p>
	<p>	We were working on our lives and our homes</p>
	<p>	Dealing with what we had, not what we didn’t have</p>
	<br>
	<p>	My life has been guided by women</p>
	<p>	But because of them – I am a man</p>
	<p>	God bless you mama – and thank you</p>
