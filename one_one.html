		<!-- broken, lost, hurt, missing -->
	<p>	And so my life has been "guided"</p>
	<p>	All the love I needed was "provided"</p>
	<p>	And through my mothers sacrifices I saw where her life "went"</p>
	<br>
	<p>	To give more than birth to me, but life to "me"</p>
	<p>	And this ain’t one of the clichés about black women being "strong"</p>
	<p>	Cause hell if you’re weak, you’re "gone"</p>
	<p>	But life courage, determined to do more than just "survive"</p>
	<br>
	<p>	And too many homes have a missing woman or "man"</p>
	<p>	Without the feeling of missing "love"</p>
	<br>
	<p>	Maybe they are homes that are "hurt"</p>
	<p>	But there are no real lives that hurt will not reach, that are not "broken"</p>
	<p>	Unless the homes of soldiers – stationed "overseas"</p>
	<p>	Or lost in battles, are "broken"</p>
	<p>	Unless the homes of firemen, policemen, construction "workers",</p>
	<p>	Seamen, railroad men, truckers, "pilots"</p>
	<p>	Who lost their lives – but not what their lives stood "for"...</p>
	<p>	Because men die, men lose, they are lost and they "leave"</p>
	<p>	And so do "women"...</p>
	<br>
	<p>	I came from what they called a broken "home"</p>
	<p>	But if they ever really called at our "house"</p>
	<p>	They would have known how wrong they "were"</p>
	<p>	We were working on our lives and our "homes"</p>
	<p>	Dealing with what we had, not what we didn’t "have"</p>
	<br>
	<p>	My life has been guided by "women"</p>
	<p>	But because of them – I am a "man"</p>
	<p>	God bless you mama – and thank "you"</p>
